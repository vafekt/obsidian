1. Fundamentals of computer networks/networking
- Computer network is a system that connects computing devices for transmitting and sharing information. Computing devices: Mobile, PCs, switch, router. These devices are connected using physical wires (fiber optics) or can be wireless.
	- For a standard communication, the devices must apply the communication protocols such as TCP/IP, IEEE 802, Ethernet, wireless LAN and cellular standards.
- Types of network:
	- Local area network (LAN): connects devices within a limited area such as schools, offices, hospitals. These devices are connected together by a switch or stack of switches, using a private addressing scheme (local network). Routers are found at the boundary of LAN, connecting them to the larger WAN.
	- Metropolitan area network (MAN):

**Initial Access**

- **Establish a foothold:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to a target system or network. This can be done through a variety of means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in software or hardware, phishing attacks, or social engineering.
    
    **Example:** An attacker sends a phishing email to a target user, tricking them into clicking on a malicious link. The link downloads malware onto the user's computer, which gives the attacker access to the system.
    
- **Identify and exploit vulnerabilities:** This tactic involves identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in the target system or network. Vulnerabilities can be found in software, hardware, or configuration settings.
    
    **Example:** An attacker scans the target network for vulnerable systems and then exploits a vulnerability in a web server to gain access.
    
- **Obtain access credentials:** This tactic involves stealing or guessing access credentials to the target system or network. Credentials can be obtained through a variety of means, such as phishing attacks, social engineering, or password cracking.
    
    **Example:** An attacker steals the credentials of a system administrator by intercepting a password reset email.
    
- **Bypass security controls:** This tactic involves circumventing security controls that are designed to prevent unauthorized access. Security controls can include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and access control lists.
    
    **Example:** An attacker uses a zero-day vulnerability in a firewall to gain access to a network.
    

**Execution**

- **Execute arbitrary code:** This tactic involves executing code on the target system or network without authorization. This code can be used to install malware, steal data, or disrupt operations.
    
    **Example:** An attacker executes a malicious script that steals the user's login credentials from a web browser.
    
- **Install tools:** This tactic involves installing tools on the target system or network to maintain persistence or further the attack. These tools can be used to steal data, escalate privileges, or bypass security controls.
    
    **Example:** An attacker installs a backdoor on a system that allows them to remotely access it.
    
- **Create or modify access tokens:** This tactic involves creating or modifying access tokens to gain unauthorized access to resources. Access tokens are used to authenticate users and applications on a network.
    
    **Example:** An attacker steals an access token that allows them to impersonate a legitimate user on a system.
    
- **Route traffic:** This tactic involves routing traffic through an intermediary system to hide the attacker's activity or bypass security controls. This can be done using proxy servers, VPNs, or Tor.
    
    **Example:** An attacker routes traffic through a compromised web server to hide their activity from security analysts.
    

**Persistence**

- **Maintain persistence:** This tactic involves establishing persistence on the target system or network to ensure continued access. This can be done by installing backdoors, rootkits, or other malware.
    
    **Example:** An attacker installs a backdoor on a system that allows them to remotely access it even after the user reboots the system.
    
- **Hide artifacts:** This tactic involves hiding artifacts of the attacker's activity to evade detection. This can be done by deleting files, modifying logs, or using encryption.
    
    **Example:** An attacker deletes their malicious scripts from the system after they have been used to steal data.
    
- **Communicate with external entities:** This tactic involves communicating with external entities to exfiltrate data or receive instructions. This can be done using email, FTP, or other protocols.
    
    **Example:** An attacker uses a web browser to upload stolen data to a remote server.
    

**Privilege Escalation**

- **Elevate privileges:** This tactic involves elevating the attacker's privileges on the target system or network to gain increased access. This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities, cracking passwords, or using social engineering.
    
    **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in an operating system to gain administrator privileges.
    
- **Bypass user authentication:** This tactic involves bypassing user authentication to gain unauthorized access to resources. This can be done by using stolen credentials, social engineering, or brute force attacks.
    
    **Example:** An attacker steals the credentials of a system administrator and uses them to log in to the system.
    
- **Obtain root privileges:** This tactic involves obtaining root privileges on the target system or network to gain full control. This can be done using the techniques listed above or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the system's rootkit.
    
    **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the operating system's kernel to gain root privileges.
    
- **Maintain elevated privileges:** This tactic involves maintaining elevated privileges to persist in the target environment. This can be done by installing persistence mechanisms or using social engineering to keep the target user from logging

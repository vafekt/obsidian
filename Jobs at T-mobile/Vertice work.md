**Cloud Security:**
- **AWS Security:** Learn AWS security best practices, including IAM, S3 bucket encryption, VPCs, and security groups. You'll likely use AWS security services like GuardDuty and Inspector.
- **Google Cloud Security (optional):** If they use Google Workspace, understanding Google Cloud Platform (GCP) security is a plus.

**Infrastructure Security:**
- **Linux Administration:** Familiarity with Linux administration is essential for managing cloud instances and internal systems.

**Security Tools and Technologies:**
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Learn how SIEM tools like Splunk or ELK Stack aggregate logs for security analysis.
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Understand how these systems detect and block malicious network traffic.
- **Vulnerability Scanning Tools:** Familiarity with tools like Nessus or OpenVAS for identifying vulnerabilities in systems.
- **Secure Coding Practices:** Knowledge of secure coding principles to prevent vulnerabilities in applications.

**Security Methodologies:**
- **Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM):** Understand the process for identifying, responding to, and recovering from security incidents.
- **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL):** Learn how to integrate security practices throughout the software development process.
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** Understand how to prevent sensitive data from being leaked or exfiltrated.
- **Compliance Frameworks:** Be familiar with relevant compliance frameworks like SOC 2 or HIPAA, depending on Vertice's industry.

**Bonus Skills:**
- **Scripting Languages (Python, Bash):** Scripting skills can automate security tasks and analysis.
- **Threat Modeling:** Understanding how to identify and mitigate potential security threats.


**Security Systems:**
- **Anti-virus applications:** Software that detects and removes malicious programs.
- **Content filtering:** Blocks access to malicious or inappropriate websites/content.
- **Firewalls:** Enforce security policies at network borders, controlling incoming/outgoing traffic.
- **Authentication systems:** Verify user identities before granting access to systems. Examples: multi-factor authentication (MFA), password management.
- **Intrusion detection and notification systems (IDS/IPS):** Detect and potentially block suspicious network activity.

**Networking Technologies & Security:**
- **Networking basics:** Understand network protocols (TCP/IP), network devices (routers, switches), and network topologies.
- **Network security:** Firewalls, intrusion detection, network segmentation (isolating critical systems).
- **Network monitoring solutions:** Tools to monitor network activity for performance and security issues.

**Web Technologies:**
- Familiarity with web application development and potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

**Development Skills:**
- **At least one scripting language (e.g., Python):** Automate security tasks, analyze logs, prototype security tools.

**Security Knowledge:**
- **Security protocols:** Encryption (SSL/TLS), secure communication channels (SSH, VPN).
- **Security principles:** Least privilege, defense in depth, secure coding practices.
- **Security best practices:** Staying updated on threats, applying security patches promptly.

**Development Lifecycle & Tools:**
- **Software development lifecycle (SDLC):** Integrating security throughout the development process (e.g., secure coding practices, penetration testing).
- **Version control system (e.g., Git):** Manage code changes securely and collaboratively.

**Cloud Experience (Preferred):**
- Familiarity with major cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) and their security offerings.

**Audits & Certifications (Preferred):**
- **SOC 2 (or similar):** Security compliance frameworks for cloud service providers.
- **GDPR:** General Data Protection Regulation (EU data privacy regulation).

**Critical Thinking & Problem Solving:**
- Analyze security incidents, identify root causes, and implement solutions.
- Stay ahead of evolving threats and adapt security measures accordingly.

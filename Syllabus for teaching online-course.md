1. Fundamentals of computer networks/networking
- Computer network is a system that connects computing devices for transmitting and sharing information. Computing devices: Mobile, PCs, switch, router. These devices are connected using physical wires (fiber optics) or can be wireless.
	- For a standard communication, the devices must apply the communication protocols such as TCP/IP, IEEE 802, Ethernet, wireless LAN and cellular standards.
- Types of network based on geographical scale:
	- Local area network (LAN): connects devices within a limited area such as schools, offices, hospitals. These devices are connected together by a switch or stack of switches, using a private addressing scheme (local network). Routers are found at the boundary of LAN, connecting them to the larger WAN. Advantages: Fast data transfer rates, easy to set up.
	- Metropolitan area network (MAN): Covers a larger area than a LAN (connects several LANs together in a city). Advantages: Higher speed than WAN, can be used as an ISP.
	- Wide area network (WAN): Covers larger areas such as large cities, countries. Provides connectivity to the Internet, but slower speed than LAN.
	- Storage area network (SAN): It is used in storage devices such as disk arrays and tape libraries.
	- VPN: Overlay private network stretched on top of a public network.
	- Cloud network: Is an WAN whose infrastructure is delivered via cloud services.
	![[Pasted image 20240215120628.png]]
	- Wireless LANs/WANs/MANs: connects devices using wireless techniques (radio waves). There is a modem connecting from a local service provider through the fiber. Then a wireless router is connected to the modem and receives the signal from the modem. This router is also called access point, using a wireless protocol, such as 802.11 standards.
- Types of network based on organizational intent:
	- Intranet: a set of networks that is maintained and controlled by a single organization. It is secured because allowing only authorized users alone.
	- Internet: a collection of multiple networks connected by routers. Internet is actually a backbone that connects all WANs together. While WAN infrastructure consists of devices like routers, switches, access points and other end devices, the Internet includes components such as data centers, undersea cables, satellites and various interconnected elements.
	- Extranet: Similar to the intranet but with the connections to particular external networks (to share resources with partners and customers).
- Network/internet protocols:
	- Network protocols: set of procedures that enables devices to communicate back and forth across the Internet. Because two devices must support the same protocol to translate the communication.
	- 3 main types of network protocols:
		- Network management protocols: to monitor, manage and maintain a network (SNMP, FTP, POP3, Telnet).
		- Network communication protocols: to exchange data across a network (TCP, UDP, IP, HTTP, BGP, ARP).
		- Network security protocols: use security measures to protect data (SSL, HTTPS, SFTP, TLS).
- Network topology
	- Bus topology
		- A topology where all devices are connected to a single cable. It is bi-directional and multi-point connection
		![[Pasted image 20240215131306.png]]
		- It is non-robust topology because if the backbone fails the topology crashes.
		- Advantages
			- Less cost compared to other topologies.
			- CSMA is the most common method for this topology
		- Disadvantages
			- If the common cable fails, the whole system will crash
			- If the network traffic is heavy, it increases collisions in the network. To avoid, we need Pure Aloha, or CSMA/CD
			- Security is very low
	- Mesh topology
		- Every device is directly connected to each other via a dedicated channels. If we have N devices, total number of ports (endpoint of the link) is N*(N-1). 
		![[Pasted image 20240215133444.png]]
		- Advantages:
			- Very robust
			- The fault can be diagnosed easily
			- Provides security and privacy
		- Disadvantages:
			- Installation and configuration are difficult.
			- The cost is high
	- Star topology
	![[Pasted image 20240215134156.png]]
		- All devices are connected to a single hub (central node) through a cable.
		- Many Ethernet LAN protocols are used as CD, CSMA.
		- Advantages:
			- If N devices are connected, only N number of cables. Very easy.
			- Cost-effective
			- If one link fails, other will not be influenced.
		- Disadvantages:
			- If the central node fails, all crash.
			- Cost of installation is high
	- Ring topology
	![[Pasted image 20240215135934.png]]
		- Devices are connected directly with two neighboring devices, represented by a repeated. The data has to pass through several nodes to reach the destination.
		- It is less costly than star topology.
		- The failure of a single node can cause the entire network to fail.
		- Troubleshooting is difficult
	- Tree topology
		- A variation of star topology
		![[Pasted image 20240215140529.png]]
		- Error detection is very easy, also allows prioritization.
- Network elements
	- End devices (computers): device that is able to accept data as input and perform task as output
	- Transmission medium: the means through which we send out data from one place to another (signal is transmitted in the form of electromagnetic energy through air, vacuum, lights). Wired or wireless.
	- Protocols: defined rules for communication
	- Network software: the software that helps people deploy, manage and monitor a network (SDN)
- Hub, Switch, Router, Modem, Access point
	- Hub:
		- the connector that connects the wires coming from different sides. It is known as a repeater that transmits signal to every port except the port from where the signal is received.
		- Operates on layer 1 (physical layer)
	- Switch:
		- Operates at the data link layer of OSI model, uses switching table to find out the correct destination.
		- Works on the basis of MAC address and ports to filter and send packets.
	- Router:
		- Operates at network layer of OSI
		- Works on the basis of IP and ports.
		- Determines the route, performs filtering and encapsulation.
	- Modem:
		- The device that converts information to signal (modulate and demodulate). It is connected to the router. It can be ADSL modem, optic modem, GPRS modem.
		![[Pasted image 20240215175156.png]]
	- Access point: It is just a switch with WLAN, and can be connected to router or directly to modem.
		- Access point name (APN): It is the gateway between the mobile network and another computer network (Internet). 
		![[Pasted image 20240215175614.png]]
		- The APN is used to find the right IP address that the device should be identified with on the network, determine if a private network is needed, choose the correct security settings that should be used.
- OSI model:
	- 7 layers (now from the lowest)
	- Physical layer
		- The lowest layer
		- Responsible for the physical connection between devices
		- Contain information in form of bits. So it is responsible for transmitting individual bits from one node to the next.
		- After receiving signal, it converts into 0 and 1 and sends to Data Link layer
		- Functions
			- Bit synchronization
			- Bit rate control
			- Transmission mode: Simplex, half-duplex, full-duplex
		- Devices: Hub, Repeater, Modem, Cables
	- Data Link Layer
		- Make sure that data transfer is error-free from one node to another.
		- Framing the dat.
		- After creating the frames, it adds MAC addresses in the header to specify the destination and source.
		- 2 sublayers
			- Logical Link Control: provides the logic as it controls the synchronization, multiplexing, flow control and error-checking functions
			- Media Access Control: defines the network card. MAC address can have unicast, multicast and broadcast
		- Protocol: Ethernet, PPP, Wi-Fi, ARP
	- Network layer
		- For the transmission of data from one host to the other located in different networks. Packet routing.
		- Defines which route is suitable from source to destination.
		- Uses packet with IP addresses
		- Protocols: IP, ICMP, IGMP, PIM, OSPF, BGP, IPsec.
			- Internet Protocol: provides the addressing and routing mechanism for data packets. IPv4 or IPv6.
			- Internet Control Message Protocol: for diagnostic and control purposes within IP networks. It is often used to report errors, perform network testing.
			- Internet Group Management Protocol: for managing group memberships with Query, Report, Done.
			- Open Shortest Path First: routing protocol commonly used within autonomous systems (AS) with types Hello, Link-state update/request/acknowledgment
			- Border Gateway Protocol: routing protocol used between different autonomous systems.
			- IPsec: suite of protocols to secure IP communications.
	- Transport Layer
		- Responsible for end to end delivery of the complete message (services).
		- Data is called segments, provides acknowledgment of the successful data transmission and re-transmits the data if an error is found.
		- 2 types:
			- Connection-oriented: TCP
			- Connectionless Service: UDP
		- TLS: ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted between applications over a network, such as the internet. It provides encryption, authentication, and data integrity verification
	- Session Layer
		- for the establishment of connection, maintenance of sessions, and authentication, and also ensures security.
		- Protocols:
			- NETBIOS: enables communication between computers on a local area network (LAN) and provides services such as name resolution, session establishment, and data transfer
	- Presentation Layer
		- Used for translation (ASCII), encryption or compression (JPEG, GIF)
	- Application Layer
		- Implemented by the applications which produce data. 
		- Displaying data or information to users
		- Protocols:
			- HTTP
			- SMTP: sending email messages between servers. It is used to send outgoing mail from email clients to mail servers
			- POP3: used by email clients to retrieve email messages from a mail server.
			- DNS
			- FTP
			- SSH: cryptographic network protocol used for secure communication over an insecure network. It provides encrypted communication between clients and servers and is commonly used for remote administration of servers.
			- SNMP: used to manage and monitor network devices and their functions remotely. It allows network administrators to collect information, configure devices, and monitor network performance.
- TCP/IP
![[Pasted image 20240215232540.png]]
- Ports and services:
![[Pasted image 20240216094457.png]]
- IP configuration:
	- Steps:
		- Setting IP, netmask
			- Manual
			- DHCP
		- DNS server
		- Default Gateway
	- In Windows
	![[Pasted image 20240216094928.png]]
	- In Linux
		- Through the system file: /etc/network
		- Through bash code
- Subnets
	- Subnetting is the way when we divide a big network into smaller networks for easy maintenance, higher security and management.
	- The network is divided into 2 parts
		- Network part
		- Host ID part
	- There are 5 classes of subnetworks
		- **Class A:** First Octet Value 0-126, 255.0.0.0
		- **Class B:** First Octet Value 128-191, 255.255.0.0
		- **Class C:** First Octet Value 192-233, 255.255.255.0
		- **Class D:** First Octet Value 224-239, for multicasting applications
		- **Class E:** First Octet Value 240-255, for experimental applications
	- Examples:
		- Mask 255.255.255.0 has 16 bits for the subnet and 8 bits of the host.
			- Have possible 2^8 -2 hosts =254 which is enough
			- 16 bits would accommodate 2^8=256 subnets
		- **Classless Inter-Domain Routing** (CIDR) allows network routers to route data packets to the respective device based on the indicated subnet. Instead of classifying the IP address based on classes, routers retrieve the network and host address as specified by the CIDR suffix
			- Write the IP address 222.1.1.20 mask 255.255.255.192 in CIDR notation:
				- Decimal 192 =11000000 binary which means that 2 bits of this octet are used for the subnet. Now add the 24 bits 255.255.255 and we have 26 bits. So we write:
				- 222.1.1.20/26
			- Subnet the Class C IP Address 195.1.1.0 So that you have 10 subnets each with a maximum 12 hosts on each subnet. List the Address on host 1 on subnet 0,1,2,3,10
				- Current mask= 255.255.255.0
				- Bits needs for 10 subnets =4 =24 =16 possible subnets
				- Bits needs for 12 hosts = 4 = 24  = 16-2=14 possible hosts.
				- So our mask in binary =**11110000**= **240** decimal
				- Final Mask =**255.255.255.240**
- Redundant methods
	- Provides strategy and plans in case a network failure occurs
	- Types:
		- Pathway redundancy
			- We have several alternate network paths. If a link is down, there is an alternative way of reaching the destination.
		- Power redundancy
			- Most network devices are dependent on electric power for them to function. That is why having a backup power source in the location of your network devices may it be a simple equipment room or a high-end data center, is a must.
		- Geographic redundancy
			- This redundancy ensures that if the main data center encounters a severe outage like a city-wide blackout that lasts longer than the power backup systems can provide an alternate data center in a different location
		- Data redundancy
	- LAN redundancy
		- Provide physical redundancy in a switched network. That is why Spanning Tree Algorithm is introduced.
		- STP ensures that there is only one logical path between all destinations on the network by intentionally blocking redundant paths that can cause a loop.
			- The physical paths still exist to provide redundancy, but are disabled when working.
			- When a path fails, STP recalculates the paths and unblocks the necessary ports to make redundant path become active.
			![[Pasted image 20240217003053.png]]
			- How to choose the root bridge?
				- First, based on bridge priority (lowest should get the root). Then based on path cost, and MAC address
				![[Pasted image 20240217003437.png]]
				- Process of BPDU propagation

				![[Pasted image 20240217003810.png]]
	- Default gateway redundancy
		- HSRP (Hot standby router Protocol)
			- With one active, one in standby. 
		- VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol)
			- With one in Master, one in backup
		- Gateway Load Balancing Protocol
- VLAN
	- logical overlay network that groups together a subset of devices that share a physical LAN, isolating the traffic for each group
	- VLANs can be port-based (sometimes called _static_) or use-based (sometimes called _dynamic_).
		- Network engineers create port-based VLANs by assigning [ports](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/port) on a network switch to a VLAN. Those ports only communicate on the assigned VLANs, and each port is on one VLAN only
		- Network engineers create use-based VLANs by assigning traffic to a VLAN dynamically, based on the traffic type or the device creating the traffic. A port might be assigned to a VLAN based on the identity of the device attached
		- A VLAN is identified on network switches by a VLAN ID. Each port on a switch can have one or more VLAN IDs assigned to it and will land in a default VLAN if no other one is assigned. Each VLAN provides data-link access to all hosts connected to switch ports configured with its VLAN ID.
		- [Trunk](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/trunk) links between switches know which VLANs span the switches, accepting and passing along all traffic for any VLAN in use on both sides of the trunk. When a frame reaches its destination switch port, the VLAN tag is removed before the frame is transmitted to the destination device.
2. Computer networks security
- Firewall, Demilitarized zone, ACL
	- Firewall
		- Is a devices (barrier) sitting between the private internal network and the public Internet. It is used to allow non-threatening traffic in and to keep dangerous traffic out.

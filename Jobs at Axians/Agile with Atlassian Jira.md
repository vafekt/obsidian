1. Agile
- It is approach to managing and working on projects (planning and doing the actual work)
- Agile can be applied:
	- Software development
	- Managing service tickets
	- Writing a book
	- Building a product
- Characteristics of agile projects
	- Agile products are built incrementally: Instead of plan, development and release all at once. Small increments of the product are planned and released in a succession.
		- Each increment should be usable and valuable to the customer
	- Agile projects are iterative: You continuously obtain feedback, learn and improve the product and the process of building the product. 
		- Each increment provides tight feedback from both users and from inside the team
	- Focus on value: working to get the highest value parts of the project. After every part, the team again decides what is the next highest value thing to work on
	- Agile projects have an empowered team: the team decides how to organize and how to accomplish its work (not a command and control system). Each member helps building the project
2. Agile as the scientific method
- Method (plan, do, check, adjust or plan, build, release)
	- Create a hypothesis (idea), and plan the work
	- Build an experiment to test the idea
	- Observe from the result to learn
	- Repeat/iterate with improvement. You can loop the process again
3. Agile vs waterfall
- Waterfall just plans and develops the whole project in phases. Every phase in the middle just produces document.
	- There is no cycle of the scientific method

Jira is a software to help manage, develop and communicate about projects. It matches Agile processes.
1. Hierarchy
- Application level (highest level): It contains a number of projects.
- Project level: contains one or more issues. An issue is any work item related to the project.
- Issue: a work item that need to be done
2. Creating a project and issues
- Click on Projects and then Create project
	- 2 types of project:
		- Classic: traditional, more functionality, mature. Having more functionality capabilities. Configurations can be shared among multiple projects
		- Next-gen: Difference on managing the projects. Instead of Jira administrators, next-gen can be created and configured by the members of the project team. Only apply to one project. 
- Enter the project name
- Enter the project key and choose the template (defines projects initial configuration. Kanban is a type of template. Scrum and Bug tracking are types of template also)
- Every issue has an issue key = [project key] + [issue number]
	- it is unique

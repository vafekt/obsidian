**Types**
- Integer: int
- Float: float
- String: str
- Boolean: True or False
- 0 is integer type
You can convert type to type (for example, from integer to float. But from float to int will be floor rounding). You can also convert string to int.

Expression and variables

**String**
my_name = “BobbyTarantino” 
print (my_name[::1]) #BobbyTarantino 
print (my_name[::-1 ]) #onitnaraTybboB 
print (my_name[::2]) #Bbyaatn 
print (my_name[::-2]) #oinrTbo

3 * "hello" == hellohellohello

Escape sequences: "\" (for example, \n or \t)

**List and tuples**
Tuples are an ordered sequence, recognized as curly brackets (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- Tuples can store any data types such as string, integer, float...
- tuples[-1] = 5
- Tuples (also list) can concatenate, which means: tuple2 = tuple1 + ("haha", 10)
- They also have slicing attributes
- But tuples are immutable
List is mutable, order sequence.
- Difference between extend and append.
